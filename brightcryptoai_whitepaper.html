						<h1 id="head1">What is Blockchain ?</h1>
						<p>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.</p>

						<h1 id="head2">Why Blockchain is Important ?</h1>
						<p>Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction endto end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.</p>

						<h3>Distributed Ledger Technology</h3>
						<p>All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical oftraditional business networks.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Immutable Records</h3>
						<p>No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions arethenvisible.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
						<p>To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.</p>

						<h1 id="head7">How Does AI Work ?</h1>
						<p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular withAI developers.</p>
						
						<p>In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.</p>
						
						<p>AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include the following:</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Learning.</h3>
						<p>This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data andcreating rules for how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by- step instructions for how to complete a specific task.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Reasoning.</h3>
						<p>This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Self-correction.</h3>
						<p> This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>Creativity.</h3>
						<p> This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new</p>

						<h1 id="head8">Why AI is Important ?</h1>
						<p>AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks done by humans, including customer service work, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks much better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks, such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors. Because of the massive data sets it can process, AI can also give enterprises insights into their operations they might not have been aware of. The rapidly expanding population of generative AI tools will be important in fields ranging from education and marketing to product design.</p>

						<p>The BrightCryptoAI protocol is comprised of three layers:</p>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>1)Consensus layer:</h3>

					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>2) Land content layer:</h3>
						<p>Download assets using a decentralized distribution system.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="context_area_inner">
						<h3>3) Real-time layer:</h3>
						<p>Enable users’ world viewers to connect to each other.</p>
						
						<p>Land ownership is established at the consensus layer, where land content is referenced through a hash of the file’s content. From this reference the content can be downloaded from BitTorrent or IPFS. The downloaded file contains a description of objects, textures, sounds, and other elements needed to render the scene. It also contains the URL of a rendezvous server to coordinate connections between P2P users that are exploring the tile simultaneously</p>
						
						<p>Additionally, two other systems are key for BrightCryptoAI’s economy to develop: <b>Payment Channel Infrastructure</b> for fast payments with low fees.</p>
						
						<p><b>Identity System </b>that allows users to establish ownership over original creations.</p>
